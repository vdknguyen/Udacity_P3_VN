Quality of Code  
  Is the code functional?  
    Model will run on simulator. On my machine, I am able to update the steering angle several times a second. Adjust speed accordingly if machine perfomance differs.  
  Is code usable and readable?
    The code will run without error if it has the correct path to the data csv. Comments about the code will follow below.
